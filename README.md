Applying K Means Clustering to target customer segmentation in R

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

Objectives: I am going to fit this dataset to K Means Clustering and thus to do customer segmentation based on those variables.

What did I do in this file?

Data preprocessing:
  1. Deal with missing value
  2. Normalize data

Find optimal K using two methods:
  1. Elbow method
  2. Average Silhouette Method

Target customer segmentation with 8 clusters
